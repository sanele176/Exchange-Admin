configure the shared mailbox or delegated mailbox so that sent messages are saved in the shared mailbox's Sent Items folder instead. 
This is done via settings in Microsoft Exchange or through PowerShell commands, depending on your setup. For example:

powershell
Set-Mailbox -Identity "SharedMailbox" -MessageCopyForSentAsEnabled $True -MessageCopyForSendOnBehalfEnabled $True
